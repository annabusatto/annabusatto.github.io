## Context-Neutral Vertical Bat Angle Modeling from Swing-Level Tracking Data

**Project Description:**  
This project estimates a context-neutral (intrinsic) Vertical Bat Angle (VBA) for each batter-side by separating swing-plane tendencies from pitch-level factors that influence observed bat angle. The goal is to produce stable, interpretable batter-side benchmarks that are not overly sensitive to pitch location, pitch type, velocity, or count context.

The adjusted VBA estimates are then explored in relation to batter-side performance metrics to assess whether certain swing-plane tendencies are associated with consistent differences in batted-ball outcomes or approach metrics, and how these insights could be used in player evaluation, development, or advance scouting.

## 1. Data Description

### 1.1 Swing-Level Tracking Inputs  
Each row represents a swing with pitch context and bat path information, including:
- **Vertical Bat Angle (VBA)** (response variable; degrees, more negative = steeper)
- Pitch context features (examples):
  - pitch location (horizontal/vertical)
  - pitch velocity
  - movement / spin
  - count (balls/strikes)
  - pitch type
- Batter-side grouping (batter × stance)

### 1.2 Batter-Side Performance Metrics  
A second table contains batter-side performance metrics (one row per batter-side), including:
- batted-ball quality proxies (e.g., peak EV, hard-hit rates/angles)
- plate approach metrics (e.g., chase/contact above expectation)
- launch-angle consistency (e.g., SD of launch angle)

## 2. Analytical Approach

### 2.1 Why “context-neutral” VBA?  
Observed VBA on a given swing reflects both:
- **hitter swing-plane tendencies**, and  
- **situational adjustments** driven by pitch shape/location/velocity and count

A simple average VBA can be biased by differences in the pitch environments hitters face. This analysis aims to isolate the hitter-side component by adjusting for pitch context.

### 2.2 Mixed-Effects Modeling (Shrinkage for Stability)  
To estimate intrinsic VBA while stabilizing small-sample hitters, I used a mixed-effects model with:
- **Fixed effects:** pitch context + pitch type  
- **Random intercept:** batter-side (batter × stance)

Conceptually:

\[
\text{VBA}_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta^\top X_{ij} + u_{\text{batter-side}} + \epsilon_{ij}
\]

This approach naturally shrinks low-sample hitter estimates toward the population mean, producing more reliable batter-side benchmarks.

### 2.3 Output Metric  
Primary deliverable:
- **Adjusted (context-neutral) VBA** per batter-side  
- plus a swing-count field for context/reliability

Interpretation:
- **More negative adjusted VBA → steeper intrinsic swing plane**
- **Less negative adjusted VBA → flatter intrinsic swing plane**

## 3. Results & Interpretation

### 3.1 What drives observed VBA?  
Pitch location (especially vertical location), pitch type, and velocity can meaningfully shift observed bat angle. Modeling these effects helps separate:
- *situation-driven variation* (pitch context), from  
- *persistent differences* (intrinsic batter-side tendency)

### 3.2 Intrinsic VBA vs Performance Metrics  
After producing adjusted VBA estimates, I explored relationships between intrinsic swing plane and batter-side performance metrics.

**Key interpretation theme:**  
VBA is a mechanical trait; many performance outcomes are multi-factor, so relationships may be weak at the population level. Still, directional patterns can be useful for:
- mechanical benchmarking and swing-change monitoring
- identifying hitter profiles that may align better with certain pitch environments
- framing development targets (consistency vs variability, plane matching, etc.)

## 5. Practical Implications

- **Player evaluation:** adjusted VBA provides a fairer comparison across hitters than raw averages by reducing pitch-environment bias  
- **Player development:** intrinsic VBA can serve as a mechanical benchmark to track swing changes over time (paired with batted-ball goals)  
- **Advance scouting:** pairing intrinsic VBA with opponent pitch profiles can help frame matchups (e.g., plane matching vs pitch shape/location trends)
