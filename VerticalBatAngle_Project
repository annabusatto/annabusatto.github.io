## Context-Neutral Vertical Bat Angle Modeling from Swing-Level Tracking Data

<img src="images/Baseball/VBA_distribution.png?raw=true"/>

**Project Description:**  
This project estimates a context-neutral (intrinsic) Vertical Bat Angle (VBA) for each batter-side by separating swing-plane tendencies from pitch-level factors that influence observed bat angle. The objective is to produce stable, interpretable batter-side benchmarks that are not overly sensitive to pitch location, pitch type, velocity, or count context.

The adjusted VBA estimates are then explored in relation to batter-side performance metrics to assess whether certain swing-plane tendencies are associated with consistent differences in batted-ball outcomes or approach metrics, and how these insights could be applied in player evaluation, development, or advance scouting.

## 1. Data Description

### 1.1 Swing-Level Tracking Inputs  
Each row represents a swing with pitch context and bat-path information, including:

- **Vertical Bat Angle (VBA)** (degrees; more negative = steeper)  
- Pitch context variables such as:
  - pitch location (horizontal and vertical)
  - pitch velocity
  - pitch movement and spin
  - count (balls and strikes)
  - pitch type  
- Batter-side identifier (batter × stance)

### 1.2 Batter-Side Performance Metrics  
A second dataset contains batter-side performance metrics (one row per batter-side), including:

- Batted-ball quality proxies (e.g., peak exit velocity, hard-hit measures)  
- Plate approach metrics (e.g., chase and contact above expectation)  
- Launch-angle consistency (e.g., standard deviation of launch angle)

*Note: All identifiers and raw datasets are excluded from the public version of this project. Figures and examples are aggregated or anonymized.*

## 2. Analytical Approach

### 2.1 Why Context-Neutral VBA?  
Observed VBA reflects both a hitter’s underlying swing plane and situational adjustments driven by pitch characteristics. Without adjustment, simple averages can be biased by differences in pitch mix, zone distribution, and count context.

This analysis aims to isolate the batter-side component of VBA by explicitly modeling pitch-level effects.

### 2.2 Mixed-Effects Modeling  
A mixed-effects framework was used to estimate intrinsic VBA while stabilizing estimates for batter-sides with uneven swing counts.

- **Fixed effects:** pitch location, velocity, movement, count, and pitch type  
- **Random intercept:** batter-side (batter × stance)

This approach pools information across swings and shrinks small-sample batter-sides toward the population mean, reducing noise-driven extremes.

## 3. Results and Interpretation

### 3.1 Drivers of Observed VBA  
Pitch location—particularly vertical location—along with pitch type and velocity, explains a substantial portion of swing-to-swing variation in VBA. Once these factors are controlled for, remaining between–batter-side differences are smaller and more stable.

### 3.2 Intrinsic VBA and Performance Metrics  
Adjusted VBA estimates were evaluated against batter-side performance metrics to identify potential relationships between swing plane and on-field outcomes.

Most relationships were modest, reinforcing that VBA functions primarily as a mechanical trait rather than a direct performance driver. However, directional tendencies provide useful context for:

- identifying swing-plane profiles associated with greater launch-angle consistency or variability  
- pairing hitter swing characteristics with opposing pitch environments  
- framing individualized development targets

## 4. Visualization and Reporting

Visualizations emphasize population-level structure and anonymized relationships rather than individual leaderboards.

- Distribution plots illustrate the spread of intrinsic VBA across batter-sides  
- Scatter plots highlight how swing-plane tendencies relate to selected performance metrics without revealing player identity

## 5. Practical Implications

- **Player Evaluation:** Context-neutral VBA enables fairer comparison across hitters by reducing pitch-environment bias  
- **Player Development:** Intrinsic VBA provides a stable mechanical reference for monitoring swing changes over time  
- **Advance Scouting:** Pairing intrinsic VBA with opponent pitch profiles can help contextualize matchup advantages
