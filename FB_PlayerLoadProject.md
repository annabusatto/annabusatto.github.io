## Analysis of Key Drivers of Total Player Load and Player Load per Minute for Collegiate Football Players

**Project description:** <div class="justify-text"> This project was conducted for a Division I collegiate football team to analyze and identify the key drivers of both total player load and player load per minute by position. The primary goal was to inform strategies for optimizing training and practice loads to enhance player availability, especially in light of a significant reduction in roster size from 120-130 players to 95-105 players, effective for the 2025-2026 season. With the roster size decreasing by approximately 20%, it is crucial to understand how to manage training and practice loads effectively to maintain player availability. By analyzing data on these variables, the project sought to provide actionable insights that could help in designing training programs that minimize the risk of injury and maximize player performance and availability.

### 1. Data Description

The data used for this project includes:

*Catapult Data:* Data was collected using Catapult GPS devices worn by players during training sessions and games. The initial step in this project involved researching to identify key metrics that could be associated with total player load and player load per minute. This research focused on variables such as distance covered, acceleration/deceleration, high-speed efforts, and other relevant metrics. The intention was to determine the variables of interest in the analysis based on football-specific research, allowing us to create a more manageable dataset from the extensive range of variables available.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
