## Case Studies of Asymmetry, Performance, and Injury in Collegiate Football Players

**Project Description:**  
This project presents longitudinal case studies of two Division I collegiate football players, a tight end and a defensive tackle, who exhibited persistently high asymmetry levels across multiple seasons. The analysis integrates force plate, GPS (Catapult), NordBord, hydration, and injury data to examine how asymmetry and performance metrics evolve over time in relation to documented injury events. Rather than attempting injury prediction, the goal of this work is to explore athlete-specific patterns and demonstrate a scalable framework for individualized monitoring within team settings.

## 1. Data Description

The data for this project includes multiple integrated athlete monitoring systems collected longitudinally across several competitive seasons.

**Force Plate Data:**  
Collected from countermovement jumps and single-leg jumps performed by Division I athletes between 2020 and 2025. Key metrics associated with asymmetry and performance were identified, including Concentric Peak Force Asymmetry, Eccentric Peak Force Asymmetry, Force at Zero Velocity Asymmetry, and Landing Impulse Asymmetry. These metrics were used to investigate asymmetry changes within individual athletes across seasons and to explore how deviations from individual baselines relate to documented injury events.

**Catapult Data:**  
GPS and inertial sensor data captured during training sessions and games, including total Player Load, Player Load per Minute, acceleration and deceleration metrics, and movement intensity bands. This data was examined alongside asymmetry profiles to explore how workload patterns and movement demands evolve in relation to performance metrics and injury events.

**NordBord Data:**  
Hamstring strength metrics obtained via the NordBord device, including peak eccentric force, bilateral strength imbalances, and force development characteristics. These measurements were used to evaluate lower-body strength asymmetry and its temporal relationship with injury events, particularly those involving the posterior chain.

**Hydration Data:**  
Urine-specific gravity (USG) measurements used to assess hydration status over time. Hydration data was included to explore potential contextual relationships between hydration status, workload exposure, and injury events.

**Injury Data:**  
Medical records documenting injury type (e.g., soft tissue vs non–soft tissue), anatomical location, and recovery duration. Injury events were cross-referenced with asymmetry and performance metrics to identify temporal patterns and contextual factors surrounding musculoskeletal injuries.

## 2. Project Process

This project followed an athlete-centered, longitudinal case study approach, prioritizing within-athlete trends over group-level inference and hypothesis testing.

### 1. Data Integration & Cleaning
- Collected and aligned multi-modal data sources across multiple competitive seasons:
  - Force plate testing
  - GPS-derived workload metrics (Catapult)
  - NordBord hamstring strength testing
  - Hydration status (urine-specific gravity)
  - Medical injury records
- Standardized date formats and testing windows across systems
- Removed incomplete or non-relevant testing sessions
- Aggregated external load metrics using rolling 15-day averages to reduce noise while preserving meaningful workload changes
- De-identified athlete data for presentation and reporting

### 2. Longitudinal Visualization & Trend Analysis
- Visualized time-series trends for key metrics, including:
  - Total Player Load and Player Load per Minute
  - Jump height, RSI-modified, and countermovement depth
  - Force plate and NordBord asymmetry metrics
- Overlaid injury events on performance and workload timelines to examine temporal proximity
- Distinguished between soft tissue and non–soft tissue injuries to improve interpretability

### 3. Asymmetry & Performance Comparisons
- Compared asymmetry metrics across testing modalities:
  - Force plate vs Catapult-derived movement asymmetry
  - Force plate vs NordBord strength asymmetry
- Examined whether large asymmetry magnitudes or rapid changes in asymmetry preceded injury events
- Evaluated athlete-specific differences in asymmetry behavior despite similar positional demands

### 4. Athlete-Specific Interpretation
- Conducted side-by-side comparisons between the two athletes to highlight:
  - Differences in injury type and laterality
  - Unique asymmetry–performance interactions
  - Divergent responses to workload accumulation
- Focused interpretation on changes from individual baseline rather than absolute thresholds

### 5. Synthesis & Applied Insights
- Summarized recurring patterns observed across data sources
- Identified scenarios where sudden workload or asymmetry changes coincided with injury events
- Highlighted limitations of generalized asymmetry thresholds and the importance of individualized context when interpreting athlete monitoring data

## Key Observations from the Case Studies

- Injury events tended to occur during **periods of rapid change** in workload (Total Player Load and Player Load per Minute) rather than during periods of consistently high load.
- Force plate–derived performance metrics (e.g., jump height, countermovement depth) often peaked near injury events, indicating that high output alone may coexist with elevated injury risk.
- NordBord asymmetry metrics were most informative when interpreted as **short-term changes from baseline**, even when absolute asymmetry magnitude was decreasing.
- The two athletes demonstrated **distinct asymmetry–injury relationships** despite similar testing protocols and positional demands.
- Hydration status (urine-specific gravity) did not show a clear or consistent relationship with injury events in these cases.

## Why Case Studies Matter

While population-level analyses are useful for establishing general trends, injury risk and performance outcomes are ultimately athlete-specific. These case studies demonstrate how similar asymmetry metrics can behave very differently depending on position, workload exposure, and individual movement strategies. This work reinforces the value of longitudinal, individualized monitoring frameworks in high-performance sport environments.
