## Collegiate Athletes Force Plate Analysis

**Project description:** This study was conducted on male and female Division I collegiate athletes from various sports to analyze changes in their asymmetries over time. Specifically, it focused on athletes who have been in the program for 3 or more years. The goal was to identify significant deviations from their baseline measurements and assess the associated risk of injury. Several asymmetry and performance metrics were evaluated.

The data used for this project includes:

*Force Plate Data:* The data utilized was collected from countermovement jumps and single-leg jumps performed by Division I athletes from multiple sports from 2020 to 2025. The initial step in this project involved identifying key metrics associated with asymmetry and performance. This research focused on variables such as Concentric Peak Force Asymmetry, Eccentric Peak Force Asymmetry, Force at Zero Velocity Asymmetry, and Landing Impulse Asymmetry. These metrics were used to investigate the asymmetry changes within individual athletes across seasons and to hopefully predict and prevent the risk of injuries.
