[Closing the Window: A position-aware metric that quantifies how defenders reduce a receiver’s space and opportunity while the ball is in the air](https://kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-analytics/writeups/closing-the-window)

<small>Developed for the NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 (Analytics Track), this project uses player-tracking data to measure defensive influence during the ball’s flight, capturing how coverage players restrict receiver options before the ball arrives. By modeling space, angles, and reachability frame-by-frame, it surfaces hidden defensive impact that traditional outcome-based metrics miss and connects late-window disruption to reduced completion rates.

[Collegiate Football Training and Practice Loads](/FB_PlayerLoadProject)

<small>
Applied analysis of training and practice load in Division I collegiate football, focused on identifying the primary drivers of total player load and player load per minute across positions. The project examines how different movement and intensity variables contribute to workload profiles, with the goal of supporting more efficient and sustainable training design.

[NBA Schedule Intensity & Recovery Stress Modeling (R Shiny App)](/ScheduleIntensity_Project)

<small>
Analysis of NBA schedules focused on quantifying how game density, travel, and recovery windows contribute to cumulative workload stress across a season. The project introduces a schedule intensity framework and an interactive R Shiny app that allows users to explore schedule-driven stress patterns for any NBA team over time.
