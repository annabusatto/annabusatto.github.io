### Sports Science & Analytics Projects

[Closing the Window: A position-aware metric that quantifies how defenders reduce a receiver’s space and opportunity while the ball is in the air](https://kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-analytics/writeups/closing-the-window)

<small>Developed for the NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 (Analytics Track), this project uses player-tracking data to measure defensive influence during the ball’s flight, capturing how coverage players restrict receiver options before the ball arrives. By modeling space, angles, and reachability frame-by-frame, it surfaces hidden defensive impact that traditional outcome-based metrics miss and connects late-window disruption to reduced completion rates.

[Collegiate Football Training and Practice Loads](/FB_PlayerLoadProject)

<small>
Applied analysis of training and practice load in Division I collegiate football, focused on identifying the primary drivers of total player load and player load per minute across positions. The project examines how different movement and intensity variables contribute to workload profiles, with the goal of supporting more efficient and sustainable training design.

[NBA Schedule Intensity & Recovery Stress Modeling (R Shiny App)](/ScheduleIntensity_Project)

<small>
Analysis of NBA schedules focused on quantifying how game density, travel, and recovery windows contribute to cumulative workload stress across a season. The project introduces a schedule intensity framework and an interactive R Shiny app that allows users to explore schedule-driven stress patterns for any NBA team over time.

[End-of-Year Performance Analysis for Collegiate Gymnastics](/Gymnastics_Report)

<small>Project completed for a Division I collegiate gymnastics team, integrating competition scores, force plate metrics, injury logs, treatments, DEXA scans, and mental health data to highlight key performance trends and support planning around athlete health and readiness.</small>

[Longitudinal Force Plate Profiling of Asymmetry and Performance in Collegiate Athletes](/AthleteProfiling_ForcePlate)

<small>
Longitudinal analysis of force plate–derived asymmetry and performance metrics in male and female Division I collegiate athletes across multiple sports. Using countermovement and single-leg jump data collected between 2020–2025, the project examines how asymmetry evolves over time, compares trends across sports and sex, and evaluates relationships between asymmetry and performance outputs. Results highlight consistent structure in asymmetry metrics, weak group-level associations with performance, and the importance of individual athlete monitoring for applied decision-making.

[Case Studies of Asymmetry, Performance, and Injury in Collegiate Football Players](/FB_CaseStudies)

<small>
Longitudinal case studies of two Division I collegiate football players examining relationships between movement asymmetry, performance metrics, and injury events across multiple competitive seasons. Using force plate, GPS, NordBord, hydration, and injury data, the project explores how athlete-specific asymmetry and workload patterns evolve over time and highlights the value of individualized monitoring over population-level thresholds.
