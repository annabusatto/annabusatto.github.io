# Lead-off Impact Analysis (R)
# ----------------------------
# This script builds tidy per-routine data, computes athlete baselines,
# and estimates the effect of the lead-off routine on teammates' routines
# later in the lineup (positions 2â€“6). It also outputs event-specific
# slopes and simple diagnostics.
#
# How to use:
# 1) Install packages if needed:
#    install.packages(c("tidyverse","readxl","lme4","broom.mixed","lubridate"))
# 2) Set your working directory to the folder with the two Excel files or
#    update the paths below.
# 3) Source this file in RStudio (source("lead_off_impact.R")).
